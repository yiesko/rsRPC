# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Proc-events watcher resubscribes instead of dying on one failed
  self-test: a transient kernel stall no longer pins polling until the
  next daemon restart (first failure still warns, later retries stay in
  debug). The self-test now reports datagram/parsed counts, telling a
  silent kernel apart from framing drift in the log line.
- Proc-events loss accounting: every observed message feeds a per-CPU
  sequence tracker over the kernel `cn_msg.seq` counter (delivery is
  officially lossy), so silent drops surface as debug gap lines plus a
  counter. Generic across topologies (wrapping-aware, re-anchors on
  counter restarts) and self-neutralizing where counter semantics do
  not hold.

### Added
- One-liner install (`scripts/install.sh`, Linux/systemd): arch
  detection, newest-release download with SHA256 (+ minisign when
  available) verification, install to `~/.local/bin` +
  `~/.config/systemd/user` with timestamped backups, service
  enable/start/linger, optional opt-in auto-update drop-in; idempotent
  re-runs update. `scripts/uninstall.sh` removes service + binary
  (`--purge` also drops config/caches/backups). Ships
  `systemd/rsrpc.service` (hardened user unit: `ProtectSystem=strict`
  + host `/tmp` bind for the IPC fan-out, `AF_NETLINK` for the proc
  watcher, personal overrides via commented drop-in examples).

## [0.33.1] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- OTA manifest signatures (minisign): releases now publish
  `SHA256SUMS.txt.minisig`, and staging requires a valid signature from
  the embedded release key before any hash is trusted (fail-closed;
  legacy non-prehashed signatures rejected). CI signs with
  `MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY` and self-verifies before publishing; the secret
  key lives only in GitHub Secrets plus an offline backup.
- Self-update (OTA) for `rsrpc-cli` (Linux x86_64 + ARM64): `--check-update`
  (exit 2 when a newer release exists), `--update [--yes]` (downloads,
  SHA256-verifies against the release manifest, stages under
  `~/.cache/rsrpc/ota/`), `--rollback` (restores the kept `.prev` image),
  and opt-in `--auto-update`/`RSRPC_AUTO_UPDATE=1` for background staging
  in the daemon (daily check + log either way). Staged binaries apply on
  the next start via atomic swap + re-exec (same PID on Linux); dev builds,
  `cargo install` copies, foreign names and read-only dirs are refused with
  a plain message. CI publishes raw `rsrpc-cli-{target}` binaries plus
  `SHA256SUMS.txt` on tag releases.

### Fixed
- `SET_ACTIVITY` replies now echo the activity intact (official echo
  semantics): `name`/`type` (Playing/Listening/Watching/Competing) and
  every other field survive the round-trip instead of being rewritten to
  `""`/`0`. The lock-step guarantee stays — a reply is always sent.
- `SET_ACTIVITY` flood guard: byte-identical republishes from one
  `(application_id, pid)` inside 5s are collapsed before broadcast
  (changed bytes and clears always pass; clears re-arm the slot), so a
  spinning SDK can no longer fan out to bridge consumers at full rate.

### Changed
- Documented the `SUBSCRIBE` blind-ACK scope: only `READY`, `ERROR` and
  `CURRENT_USER_UPDATE` are ever dispatched; voice/guild/message/invite/
  relationship/entitlement subscriptions are ACKed and then silent (they
  need the real Discord client).
- **Breaking:** fallible APIs now return `rsrpc::error::RsrpcError`
  (`thiserror`) instead of boxed errors; `ClientConnector::new`,
  `WebsocketConnector::new` and `RPCServer::start` return `Result`
  (bind failures surface to the caller — the library never exits the
  process anymore); `AppId`/`SocketId` newtypes replace raw strings for
  slot ids (same wire format); `remove_detectable_by_name(&str)`;
  `get_user_response` renamed to `user_response` (deprecated shim kept);
  `process_alive`/`suppresses` renamed to `is_process_alive`/
  `is_suppressed`; over-`pub` items narrowed to `pub(crate)`.
  Error messages are lowercase; public constructors document `# Errors`.

- Proton-aware detection: `win32` executables from the main database are
  now indexed in a fallback automaton on Linux. Wine/Proton games whose
  Steam AppId is unreadable match by path instead of staying invisible.
  Precedence is native patterns, then user overrides, then the Steam
  AppId, then the Proton patterns, then the stem/folder heuristics.
- Alternative titles (`aliases`) are preserved by the trim and indexed
  for stem/folder matching (same conservative multi-word gate as
  canonical names, which win ties). The bundled snapshot was regenerated
  with aliases (1397 entries carry them).
- Discord detection exclusions (`GET /games/detectable/exclusions`):
  installer/crash-reporter basenames + regex patterns are dropped before
  any matching. Fetched hourly alongside the DB when `--enable-db-update`
  is set (`--exclusions-url`/`RSRPC_EXCLUSIONS_URL` overrides); empty set
  behaves exactly like before.
- `tools/updater` now uses the shared `rsrpc::detection::trim_detectable`
  instead of a hand-rolled copy (the copy had silently dropped aliases
  from the bundled snapshot).
- Steam library provider: install-dir -> AppId from Steam's own files
  (`libraryfolders.vdf` + `appmanifest_<id>.acf` + `compatdata/<id>/pfx`),
  for games whose per-process store id is unreadable. Roots are found
  dynamically (running `steam` via `/proc`, `PATH`, mounted partitions
  via `/proc/mounts`, home fallbacks — a secondary library never shadows
  the primary root); `$RSRPC_STEAM_ROOT` overrides exclusively,
  `$RSRPC_STEAM_LIBRARIES` (`:`-separated) adds manually. A JSON cache
  with per-library fingerprints revalidates by stat and reparses only
  what changed. Precedence: Steam AppId, Proton patterns, Steam
  install-dir, stem/folder — except shortcut-range AppIds (high bit set,
  assigned by Steam itself to non-Steam shortcuts, e.g. 2532755798):
  those self-identify as non-Steam, so the exe/folder name wins over
  location instead.
- Event-driven detection (Linux): a netlink `cn_proc` watcher classifies
  `EXEC` processes the moment they spawn (cards in milliseconds, not next
  tick) and wakes the scan loop early when a tracked game `EXIT`s
  (clears at once). Best-effort with a boot self-test — kernels/LSMs
  that silently drop `cn_proc` fall back to pure polling with one honest
  log line; steady state is a single blocking `recv`, and only tracked
  pids can trigger an early scan. The scan cadence itself moved from
  `sleep` to `park_timeout` to allow the wakeups. Operational note:
  systemd units sandboxing with `RestrictAddressFamilies` must add
  `AF_NETLINK`, otherwise the subscription fails and the scanner stays
  on polling (this was the production failure mode — diagnosed via the
  missing `watcher live` line).
- Overrides v2: `--overrides-dir`/`RSRPC_OVERRIDES_DIR` loads every
  `*.json` in a directory (array or single object per file, sorted,
  corrupt files skipped with a warning) additive to `--overrides-file`
  — the home for MultiMC/Prism/Hydra mappings and Proton-only titles.
  Loading moved into a library module (`rsrpc::overrides`, shared
  defaults) and `append_detectables` stages pre-start: `--list-detected`
  now applies staged overrides AND the ignore-list, so diagnostics show
  exactly what the daemon would publish (previously main-DB-only).
- Hardening (correctness + DoS): the detection database (automata,
  indexes, lists, aux maps) now swaps atomically per generation — a
  refresh landing mid-scan can no longer panic or mis-attribute games;
  the VDF parser is iterative with depth/file/token caps; exclusion
  regexes are capped and matched as one size-limited `RegexSet`; the
  handoff tables are bounded (dead owners purged, hard cap 64); all
  network fetches carry timeouts; `/proc`/VDF reads are size-capped;
  hot-path locks survive poisoning instead of killing the daemon.
- Scan efficiency (measured with hotpath-rs, see `cargo profile
  profiling`): case-insensitive automata (no per-process lowercase
  allocation), borrowed paths (`Cow`, zero alloc on the common case),
  memoized SteamAppId per pid (one environ read per process lifetime,
  swept per tick, invalidated on EXEC), `HashSet` exclusions, hoisted
  broadcast serialization, and idle backoff (5s → 30s cap, reset by any
  detection or early wake — EXEC still delivers starts instantly).
  Steady state: ~0.4% CPU, ~57MB RSS; per-process classify 54µs → 23µs.

- Total detection blindness from size-checking `/proc` files: they
  report `st_size 0` despite having content, so the check skipped every
  process (only IPC-driven cards kept showing). Removed the checks, kept
  the byte caps; regression-tested against our own pid.
- EXIT-wake storm: tracked short-lived Proton helpers unparked the scan
  loop several times per second (0.76s effective cadence during NFS).
  Wakes are debounced to at most one per second now.
- Exclusive sources diluted on refresh: `RSRPC_STEAM_ROOT` (and injected
  layouts) were merged with re-discovered roots on every folders change.
  Refresh re-resolves from the same source discovery used.
- `RSRPC_DEBUG=1` (and friends) rejected by clap bool parsing, crashing
  the daemon at startup: all env-backed bool flags accept
  `1/0/true/false/yes/no/on/off` now.
- Dead re-entrancy guard (`scanning` checked but never set): real RAII
  guard, acquired atomically and released on every exit path.
- IPC/bridge bind exhaustion no longer panics the daemon: `create_socket`
  failures surface as typed `RsrpcError::IpcBind` / `WsBind` (keeping the
  last `io::Error` as source) through the fallible `start()`; `to_fs_name`
  failures propagate instead of unwrapping.
- Poison-tolerance gaps closed: the last bare `lock().unwrap()`s on hot
  paths (bridge, handoff, replay cache, Steam prefix, `start()`) use
  `into_inner`; double `start()` on any connector is a logged no-op
  instead of a panic (including a `started` guard on the scan loop).
- Automaton build failures (pathological DB exceeding builder limits)
  keep the current generation with a warning instead of panicking the
  refresh thread or startup; same fail-open as the empty-DB guard.
- Error fidelity: `InvalidJson` keeps the serde error as `source`;
  `database_summary` returns `RsrpcError`; bridge bind message lowercased
  without log prefix; `# Errors` on all fallible constructors.
- Custom steam SKUs participate in AppId matching (linear fallback,
  canonical map wins); main patterns beat custom ones across 64-bit
  path variants (automata probed outer, variants inner) — both
  regression-tested.
- Stale AppId race closed: memoized environ carries an invalidation
  sequence, so an EXEC racing an in-flight read discards (never pins)
  the pre-exec environ; EXIT-wake debounce peeks before consuming, so a
  recent tracked EXIT can still wake later.
- Diagnostics parity: `--list-detected` applies exclusions when hourly
  updates are on (fail-open fetch, like the daemon); a fetched-but-garbage
  DB falls back to the bundled snapshot instead of killing boot.
- Watcher honesty: netlink fallback logs at `warn` (the documented
  one-line diagnosis for `AF_NETLINK` sandboxing); the boot self-test
  falls back to polling (never claims live) when it cannot prove
  delivery; steady-state datagrams sized 64KiB for EXEC storms.
- Steam provider hardening: cache entries re-validate library ownership
  on load; fingerprints cover `compatdata` appearances; `read_limited`
  re-checks size after reading (stat/read TOCTOU); VDF tokenizer caps
  tokens and counts mid-stream; mounts-table escapes decoded in one pass;
  library scans capped; `mount_library_roots_for` tested for escapes.
- Input robustness: WebSocket handlers drop (logged) frames that cannot
  encode instead of panicking the poll loop; fan-out encode failures and
  dead-peer IPC replies log at debug; `last_process` bounded like the
  handoff tables; remaining bool flags (`--list-detected`,
  `--list-database`) and the logger accept boolish values.
- Dotted titles match their folders as a last tier (`R.E.P.O.`, `Q.U.B.E.`,
  `Mr. Bomber`): the exact walk still skips dotted components as versions,
  then a de-dotted twin map (`undotted_names`, canonical-first ties) is
  consulted — exact matches always win. Punctuation forbidden in Windows
  filenames (`: ? " < > | * / \`) already folds in `normalize_name`.
- Observability without debug builds: boot logs the database source and
  entry count (`fetched-direct/trimmed/bundled-fallback`, `file`,
  `bundled`, `empty`); the scan loop logs first sightings per game id
  per boot at INFO (bounded, same cadence as bridge publishes). A silent
  daemon is now distinguishable from a blind scanner.
- Scan liveness tripwire: the first completed tick logs its game count
  at INFO once per boot (`First tick complete: N game(s)`), so a scan
  loop that never completes its first pass is visible without debug.
- Native-presence capture: a peer that connects but never handshakes
  (bailed SDK probe, crashed launcher) logs one INFO line instead of
  debug-only, so clients the bridge never identifies leave a trace.
- Rich presence fidelity: `SET_ACTIVITY` frames round-trip every modeled
  field (details/state, timestamps, assets+urls, party+privacy, secrets,
  buttons, flags, emoji, display type) on both JSON and MessagePack legs,
  and unmodeled future keys survive via a flattened catch-all instead of
  being dropped on parse — verified live against the daemon and pinned by
  a round-trip test.
- IPC sockets in every official dir: the bound `discord-ipc-{n}` is
  symlinked into `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/`TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP`/`/tmp` (Discord's
  resolution order), so games probing any location find the bridge; stale
  ours-shaped links repoint, foreign files are never touched, links die
  with the socket.

## [0.32.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- Generic process payloads carried `timestamps.start` as a string;
  strict clients (Equibop) silently drop mistyped frames, so generic
  cards never displayed. Epoch millis are now emitted as a number end
  to end (`DetectableActivity.timestamp`, `ScannedGame.start`,
  `ProcessTimestamps.start`).
- The scan loop forwarded only the first detected game, starving
  co-running games (WuWa + NTE). Every detected game now gets its own
  per-slot event with per-id dedup and no cross-clearing; the null
  event drains every armed slot.
- App slots whose IPC/WS owner died without CLEAR stayed suppressed by
  a ghost owner forever (`send_empty` carries no app id). Abrupt closes
  now release every slot owned by the dead pid and resume their
  generics.
- Steam AppId fallback via command line (`reaper SteamLaunch
  AppId=4508340 ...`) when `/proc/<pid>/environ` is unreadable.
  Sandboxed Proton runtimes (pressure-vessel/bwrap) hide environ from
  service contexts while cmdline stays readable — without this, games
  like NTE are invisible to automatic detection.

## [0.32.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- `docs/systemd-user-units.md`: practical guide to user units
  (anatomy, drop-ins, lifecycle, logs, linger, gotchas, from-scratch
  recipe) with real examples from this setup.

### Fixed
- `party.privacy` (0 = private, 1 = public) and `status_display_type`
  (0 = name, 1 = state, 2 = details) were silently dropped on parse
  (serde ignores unknown fields) — real SDKs (pypresence, Tauon) send
  them. Both now cross the bridge untouched.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- arRPC protocol parity: `SUBSCRIBE`/`UNSUBSCRIBE` blind ACKs, `Unknown
  command` / `CONNECTIONS_CALLBACK is not supported` ERROR replies
  (code 1000), invite-code validation (4011/4017), malformed-frame
  rejection (4005), 1 MiB IPC payload limit with `1003` close, refusal
  of unknown packet types (1003) instead of misreading them as frames.
- Microsecond/nanosecond timestamp normalization to milliseconds
  (seconds/milliseconds behavior unchanged).
- Bridge port-range scan (`--bridge-port`..`--bridge-port-end`,
  default 1337-1347 like arRPC) with MessagePack collision skip.
- Bounded bridge replay cache (50 entries, oldest-first eviction) with
  30s rebroadcast refresh for late/missed clients.
- Runtime identity: `RSRPC_USER_*` startup overrides plus bridge
  `SET_USER`/`RESET_USER` with ACKs (whitelisted keys only, blank
  strings ignored like the env overrides, huge integers clamped
  instead of wrapping); READY frames reflect the current identity on
  every transport.
- Presence state snapshot (`RSRPC_STATE_FILE=1` writes
  `<tmpdir>/rsrpc-state-{0..9}` with servers + activities, arRPC
  layout, `rsrpc-` prefix); `--list-database` summary diagnostics.
- Official-protocol gaps closed: `GET_USER` (current identity, or
  `null` for other ids) on IPC + websocket; `GIFT_CODE_BROWSER`
  forwarded like the other `*_BROWSER` commands (`4016` on missing
  code); clickable-asset URL fields (`details_url`, `state_url`,
  `large_url`, `small_url`) preserved through the bridge;
  `CURRENT_USER_UPDATE` DISPATCH fanned out to bridge clients on
  `SET_USER`/`RESET_USER`.
- Honest errors for known-but-unbacked commands (shared table):
  OAuth → `5000`, activity invites → `5006`, voice/guilds/overlay/
  store → "requires the real Discord client"; genuinely unknown
  commands still get `Unknown command`.
- IPC-wins handoff: generic process detection shows immediately and
  yields its slot when a game SDK publishes for the same app (last
  publisher wins across companions; stale closes ignored), resuming
  while the game process is still alive when the source clears.
  `--ignore-ids` stays as full-silence opt-in, no longer needed for
  companions.
- Stale IPC socket PING/PONG probe (1s): wedged holders are reclaimed,
  live holders (Discord/arRPC/rsRPC) are left alone.
- `--ignore-ids` / `RSRPC_IGNORE_IDS`: scan-only coexistence filter —
  ignored application IDs behave as absent (null event, clear) so a
  richer publisher owns those slots; forwarded client frames always
  pass, and `--list-detected` still shows ignored games.
- Log severity system (`DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARN`/`ERROR`): `RSRPC_LOG_LEVEL`
  sets the floor (default `info`), `--debug` / `RSRPC_DEBUG=1` forces
  debug and prints the resolved config; `INFO` keeps the historical
  untagged shape, other levels are tagged.
- Presence log lines: `Published: {name} (app {id}, pid {pid})` via a
  `display_name()` fallback (name → details → state → `?`), `INFO` on
  change and `DEBUG` on duplicate republishes/clears.

### Changed
- Tree-wide log reclassification: per-tick chatter (scan ticks, match
  details, repeat sends) demoted to `DEBUG`, fallbacks/retries/prunes
  to `WARN`, so the default log shows one line per state change.
- Hourly DB refresh logs condensed to one line per check (`DB check:
  unchanged (etag …)` / `same bytes` / `updated: N entries`).
- `SUBSCRIBE`/`UNSUBSCRIBE` and unknown/unbacked commands are answered
  at the edge (ACK/ERROR) and no longer forwarded to bridge clients;
  only `SET_ACTIVITY` and the known secondary commands
  (`INVITE_BROWSER`, `GUILD_TEMPLATE_BROWSER`, `GIFT_CODE_BROWSER`,
  `DEEP_LINK`) reach the bridge.
- State snapshot is rewritten on every 30s refresh tick, so a
  live-but-idle daemon never looks stale to slot reuse.

### Fixed
- `SET_USER` patch can no longer wipe identity fields with blank
  strings or wrap `flags`/`premium_type` on out-of-range integers.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- Install-folder fallback in process detection (Hydra / non-Steam layouts
  with generic exes), cwd-joined probe for bare-exe Proton launches.
- Suspended (SIGSTOP'd) processes count as absent; republished on resume.
- Conditional database refresh (ETag + content hash): unchanged hours cost
  one header round trip, no parse or rebuild.
- Startup database ownership moves to the scanner (no pinned duplicate
  generation); refresh ETag seeded from the startup fetch.
- Fail-fast supervision: worker panics exit for systemd restart; hot-path
  channel sends are fail-soft.
- Bridge backpressure: dead websocket clients are pruned on failed send.
- `spectate`/`match` activity secrets preserved through the bridge.
- Empty database updates refused (keeps serving current data).
- CI: test + doc jobs, `--locked` everywhere, modern actions, Node 24
  runtimes, cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows) clippy.

### Fixed
- Stuck presence after game close (dual-keyspace clear: IPC pid-keyed vs
  process app-id-keyed desync).
- Server panic on malformed WS disconnect without args.
- macOS/Windows builds (Linux-only `malloc_trim`, `read_steam_app_id`,
  `parse_stat_state` gating; per-OS memory release).

### Changed
- Scan I/O: `/proc/<pid>/environ` read only on executable-pattern misses.
- Logging is lazy (no allocation when disabled); DB parses skip the JSON
  DOM (`serde` ignores unknown fields).
- Path-variant scratch buffers reused across processes/scans.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added
- Dual-protocol bridge (JSON + MessagePack), bundled offline detectable
  snapshot with hourly refresh, custom overrides.
- Install-folder fallback in process detection.
- Single-shot `--list-detected` diagnostics.

### Fixed
- Stuck presence after game close.
