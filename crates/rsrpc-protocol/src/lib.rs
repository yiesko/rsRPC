//! rsRPC wire protocol: errors, bridge payloads, reply builders, flood guard.
//!
//! The only workspace-internal dependency is [`rsrpc_types`]: no I/O,
//! no threads, no HTTP client (fetch failures arrive opaquely wrapped by
//! the caller).
//! Payload builders return `Arc`-shared values so broadcast fan-out clones
//! a pointer, never the payload (`mem-zero-copy`).
