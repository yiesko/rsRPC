//! Modern async WebSocket server with bounded queues and graceful shutdown.
//!
//! `rsrpc-ws` replaces the 2021-era vendored `simple-websockets` crate:
//! every queue is bounded, no lock is held across `.await`, slow consumers
//! are pruned instead of growing memory without bound, and [`Server::shutdown`]
//! terminates all connection tasks deterministically.
//!
//! The primary consumption pattern is an async event loop over [`EventHub`].
