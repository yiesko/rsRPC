//! Event hub: the [`Event`] stream plus the cheap-clone [`Responder`].
//!
//! The central rule this module enforces: **no lock is held across `.await`**.
//! [`Responder`] owns only an `mpsc::Sender` and an `Arc<ConnectionDetails>`,
//! so cloning it per connection — or per task — never duplicates headers or
//! blocks. The server-side client map (owned by the consumer) is only ever
//! borrowed for the duration of a `HashMap` lookup, never across a receive.
